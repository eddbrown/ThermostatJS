# ThermostatJS
This project was experimenting with javascript and jquery, tested with Jamine, to produce a web-app that models a home thermostat.


The strengths of the project are in the TDD and the simplicity of the code. The testing was done with Jasmine. I have to say, it was a pleasure to learn how to use this testing technology.

The methods were made in full and then refactored. I had a goal of trying to get each method to be one line in content. This of course lead to some confusing lines so it was worth keeping them at a couple of lines long

Any thoughts on how to improve and extend the code are very welcome!
